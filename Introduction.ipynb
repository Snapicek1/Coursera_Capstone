    "Brno is the second biggest city in the Czech Republic and currently have a big issue with transport, especially by car. In 2008 Brno has more than 7 thousand registered car accident. In this time there are around 400 thousand inhabitants. Main proposes of this project is to find and highlight the main traffic area map with the highest possibility for car accident based on data source from Car accident police records datasheet. I choose for the now smaller area as the city. In the future, I can extend this are to NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) 3 (Regions) or NUTS 1 (Country).\n",

    "           Include data which could have higher k-value for car accident and injuries, death coll and higher value of the damage. \n",

This source could be possibly applied to Mapy.cz (local service provider similar to Google Maps or Waze) to inform drivers before they drive or to calculate another road. "

In this case, you can download the RAR object, which contains all NUTS 3 data (Regions), but not only for Brno city.
